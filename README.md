# *About Me*
Hello! My name is Evan Cardinal and I am a first-year master of science, public policy and management (MSPPM) student at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. This is my public profile for Telling Stories with Data--a data viz course at Heinz. Throughout my time in graduate school, I yearn to build upon my analytical skill-set to perform responsible and effective data science--hopefully, conducting such quantitative work in the burgeoning field of sporting data analytics. 

# *What I Hope to Learn*
In Telling Stories with Data, I strive to learn the intricacies of data visualization to make my future data analysis more accessible to audiences of all backgrounds. It is one thing to explicate data; presenting these findings to the masses is often the more difficult, yet gratifying goal. More intently, I want to learn the following data viz items that I believe will best serve me as a data scientist in sports analytics post-graduation: 

- Translate raw data into clear, concise visual mediums
- Prepare more intricate visualizations beyond basic Excel charts and graphics
- Tap into visual thinking to better understand data trends personally
