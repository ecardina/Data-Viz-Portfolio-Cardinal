# Wireframes / Storyboards
Per [Part I](https://ecardina.github.io/Data-Viz-Portfolio-Cardinal/final-project-part-one) of the project, I utilized Flourish and Infogram to create more polished dataviz, yet ultimately wireframes of my sportswashing story. After formulating the visualizations, I embeded them in Shorthand to form a storyboard to visually represent the setup (e.g. framing money in soccer and defining sportswashing), conflict (e.g. presenting the issue of sportswashing in the English Premier League), and resolution (e.g. implying future sportswashing implications and including a call to action) portions of the narrative. You can view a preview of the the wireframes and storyboards on [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/XcyWc0vycEkse1BT). 

# User Research 
As a novice in data visualization, it is critical to seek feedback on the visual and storytelling elements. The following sub-sections will identify the target audience I want to reach, the interview script I presented, and the results of three interviews I conducted to better guide my final story presentation. 

## Target Audience
Sportswashing is a relatively niche issue not particulary affecting the American sports industry. Personally, I did not know much about sportswashing or the narrative in England despite being a diehard supporter of the league and the club Tottenham Hotspur. This means that even the most devoted sports fans in this country do not necessarily understand the topic or its nuances--unless they are well-versed in international golf, autoracing, and soccer competitions. To bridge this knowledge gap, my primary audience is American soccer fans who are unaware of sportswashing and the implications it has in eroding the communal aspects of their beloved soccer clubs. Equipped with knowledge on sportswashing, readers/viewers of the story optmistically will grow a vested interest in protecting the identities of their club and combat sportswashing interests. 

## Interview Process/Script
To gather user feedback, I wanted to interview individuals representing a wide-spectrum of interests despite the focused target audience. Because in reality, the audience to publically-accessible material like this storyboard stumble across things that look and sound interesting in this age of information. Moreover, feedback from a more diverse group should aid in providing unique and common critiquing threads simultaneously that will help guide my revisions in the final iteration of the story. Of the three individuals I decided to interview, only one fits the target audience of American soccer fans with allegiances to the English Premier League. The other two are individuals without knowledge of sportswashing or soccer for that matter. 

Unformity is key when gathering user feedback. Therefore, I decided to provide the same interivew script of three questions to the interviewees. Since the [Shorthand preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/XcyWc0vycEkse1BT) of the storyboard is not text-heavy, I really wanted to center the interviews on how well the story is being depicted through the visualizations solely. I then wanted to pick the interviewees brains about the aesthetic choices I made in the storyboard (see **Moodboard** section below). The questions in their entirety are detailed below along with the ultimate goals of each. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Determine if the storyboard visualizations create a clear, decisive story    | How would you describe the story being told?                 |
|  Determine if the storyboard visualizations create a clear, decisive story;  Diagnose the effectiveness of the aesthetic choices    | Are the graphics clear and persuasive? If not, what would you suggest doing otherwise?                 |
|   Diagnose the effectiveness of the aesthetic choices   |  Does the color scheme aid in telling the story? If not, how would you change it?                |

## Interview Findings
Below, is a table documenting a general profile of each interviewee and their specific insights to the interview questions. 

| Questions               | Interview 1 - A 64-year-old woman who does not watch soccer  | Interview 2 - A 23-year-old college student who is an avid soccer fan | Interview 3 - A 24-year-old college student who does not watch soccer |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How would you describe the story being told?  | Insightful feedback            |             |             |
|                         |                                |             |             |
|                         |                                |             |             |
