# Outline
Sports are an international language traversing cultures and creeds for the love of competition and camaraderie. However, the highest levels of professional sports have turned into lucrative businesses with another construct that knows no bounds--money. The flowing abundance of investment in players and teams often grows the respective game internationally for the better in most athletic competitions. However, many sporting reputations have been marred in recent years through funding streams deriving from controversial actors.

Journalists, academics, and human rights advocates alike categorize these dodgy investors as "sportswashing"--a buzzword referring to using the benevolence associated with sports to shift focus away from previous transgressions. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, China, Russia, and UAE underscore the main human right abusers investing in international soccer, racing, and olympic competitions.
