# Outline
Sports are an international language traversing cultures and creeds for the love of competition and camaraderie. However, the highest levels of professional sports have turned into lucrative businesses with another construct that knows no bounds--money. The flowing abundance of investment in players and teams often grows the respective game internationally for the better in most athletic competitions. Yet, many sporting reputations have been marred in recent years through funding streams deriving from controversial actors.

Journalists, academics, and human rights advocates alike categorize these dodgy investors as "sportswashing"--a buzzword referring to using the benevolence associated with sports to shift focus away from previous transgressions. State-sponsored investments representing interests from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, China, Russia, and UAE underscore nations whose decades of documented human right abuses are slowly being obscured through their role in international soccer, racing, and olympic competitions. Ultimately, it is up to the collective efforts of players, governments, the media, and fan bases to pressure against the likes of sportswashing putting a stain on the beautiful games of sport. 

## Story outline
### **Setup:** 
- Sports are a revenue-generating industry at the highest levels 
- Foreign investments in the EPL, in particular, is trending upwards over the years
### **Conflict:** 
- Many foreign investors are sportswashing as they cover their human right abuses 
### **Resolution:** 
- Boycotting particular clubs with sportswashing owners or events where these states are hosting can initiate ground-level changes in international sporting competitions

## Initial sketches
### Setup Sketch

This sketch reflects the setup stage of the story by laying the visual groundwork of the growing sportswashing trend. The linechart is simple, yet effective in delineating the trend while the title itself illustrates the turn in the tide of ownership within the English Premier League--arguably, the most notable first-tier soccer league in the world. The data itself will be scraped from reputable web pages of Premier League clubs as an ownership dataset is not publically available online. 

For the sports revenue point, I think an infographic or a call out statistic may be beneficial to highlight the sheer money-making potential of various sports league of note (e.g. MLB, NBA, NFL, EPL, etc.). Moreover, the grassroots resolution and call to action will benefit from call-outs and/or infographics as well. 

### Conflict Sketches

Freedom Houses'[global freedom index](https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores) is a useful tool to categorize states' civil liberties and rights. These scores plot well in a horizontal bar chart or other comparison chart. The "ghost lines" were my attempt to show the gap in the sportswashing violators' scores from better scores. However, an additional line showing the average freedom score for all states and/or including higher ranking countries may make the dataviz resonate more.

Albeit a bit crass of a rendering, the minimalist visualization is illustrative of the horrors migrant workers endured in the years leading up to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. A more polished wireframe may utilize a unit chart type rather than the pictorial approach as it can capture the magnitude of lives lost in a simpler and less triggering rendition of the data.
