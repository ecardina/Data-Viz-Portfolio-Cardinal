# The Final Data Story
Read the final Shorthand story entitled, "Sportswashing: Money Over Culture" [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/sportswashing-money-over-culture/index.html)

# Changes Made Since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 
To alleviate some of the stress of the learning curve of Shorthand and dataviz, I created an impact versus feasibility visualization to prioritize my changes outlined in the user feedback from Part II. 
![Impact Versus Feasability Viz](./Feasibility Viz.jpg)
Per the above image, I began making changes from the upper right and worked my way down in a southwestern movement to maximize the most feasible/impactful changes to the audience. Firstly, I altered the snaking orientation of the text and dataviz in Shorthand to be more centered and therefore minimize eye travel when processing the story.
